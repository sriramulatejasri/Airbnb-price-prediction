        ### üéØ How it Works
        This predictor uses a *Random Forest* algorithm trained on Airbnb listing data including:
        - Property characteristics (room type, availability)
        - Location factors (neighbourhood group)
        - Social proof (number of reviews)
        - Booking requirements (minimum nights)

        The model learns complex patterns in pricing to provide accurate estimates for new listings.

        ### üìà Model Performance
        - *Mean Absolute Error (MAE)*: Average prediction error in dollars
        - *R¬≤ Score*: Proportion of price variance explained by the model

        Note: This is a demonstration model trained on simulated data for educational purposes.
